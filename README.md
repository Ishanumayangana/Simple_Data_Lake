# Data Lake Project

This Python project demonstrates how to collect, store, retrieve, analyze, and visualize data using **SQLite**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. The application is built around the concept of a *data lake*, where data is stored in raw form and then processed for analysis and insights.

## Features
- **Data Storage**: Uses SQLite to store collected data with timestamps.
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieves stored data as a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculates statistical insights such as mean and standard deviation.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates time-series plots of the stored data for better understanding.

## Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed in your Python environment:
- **Python** (3.7 or higher)
- **Pandas**: `pip install pandas`
- **Matplotlib**: `pip install matplotlib`
- **SQLite3**: Pre-installed with Python.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code, Replit).
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
